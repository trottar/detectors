CLAS12 TOF README

--------------------------------------------------

The geometry consists of 3 panels of scintillators:

- 1a, which is the CLAS6 TOF paddles 1-23
- 1b, which is the newly constructed for clas12,
  in front of 1a
- 2 which is 5 paddles from CLAS6 at large angles

In MYSQL mode, before building the geometry one must
upload the parameters onto the DB.

The commands to build the geometry, banks, hit defs
and materials are:

upload_parameters.pl config.dat   < only for MYSQL factory

./ftof.pl config.dat
